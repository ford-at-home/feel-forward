# Feel Forward â€” Deployment Guide

This version of Feel Forward is **manual and prompt-based**. You can use it locally or in your favorite note-taking app.

Future versions will deploy as a full-stack app using AWS.

---

## Manual Mode (Now)

1. Open `PROMPTS.md`
2. Follow each phase using Claude or ChatGPT
3. Save output between phases in local files (e.g., `preferences.json`, `scenarios.md`, `reactions.txt`)
4. Use the final summary to guide real-world decisions

3. Add CI/CD via GitHub Actions
4. Enable Bedrock, Claude, or OpenAI for agent runtime
